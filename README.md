This mobile application was made during a National competition held by Atast Organization in Tunis and got the third place.

This native android mobile app helps connects between Farmers and their farm. You guessed it right, it's an IOT project.
The farmer can therefore check different farming values which are provideds with sensors, he can control different variables with the app for a better production.

Focused on making the design as simple as possible, and the Tab view was the way to do so.
Made different gauges for different fetched values.
